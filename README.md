# df-combat-clicker
-Python script for automated clicking to farm gold in DragonFable, used for ChaosWeaver in the Ninja Arena quest.

-Mostly timing based using a quick rotation based on the number of opponents, requires the game to be open as a window, and be on top.

-Prone to breaks either duo to flash being laggy or network delays, honestly, unless you would want to leave it on for the night or something, you're better off doing it manually.

-Simply run from command line, then swap to the game window, ready to start the quest. The magic constants are entirely based upon window size, so feel free to just convert them into ratios then compute them for yourself based on your window's parameters. Alas' I'm lazy for that.

-Check out the game itself on [the official site](https://dragonfable.com).
